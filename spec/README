To test the VMs: 

1. Install the following gems on the host system:
  - beaker
  - beaker-rspec
  - fission (if you want to use VMware Fusion VMs)
2. Create a ~/.fissionrc file listing where the VMware VMs are located
3. Place the VMware VM with the desired name in the directory listed
  in the ~/.fissionrc file
4. Create a snapshot of the VM once, with the name specified in the host file
  which is "initial" by default.
  - spec/acceptance/nodesets/default.yml has the name of the VM and snapshot
2. From the parent directory (..) execute:  
    `beaker exec rspec spec/acceptance`
  - This will use the spec/acceptance/nodesets/default.yml 
    file to determine what SUTs to use etc.
  - The *_spec.rb files in the spec/acceptance directory specify the tests
